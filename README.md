# mars-stats--preact

rework of existing mars stats using preact. this time code is optimized, thanks copilot

TODO:

- fix duplicated /is-auth requests
- handle server downtime (by repeatable requests for example) since free hosting is falling asleep once inactive for a while
- sort corporations in dropdown by winrate (faster find corporation0 or just A->Z sorting ???
- rename users to steam nicknames
